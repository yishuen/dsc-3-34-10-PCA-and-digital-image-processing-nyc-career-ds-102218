    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at applying PCA on simple datasets in order to understand the mechanism of this algorithm. PCA really shines when applied to complex high dimensional data. In this lesson, we shall look at Image Processing and how PCA can help us analyze, recognize and compress spatial image data by reducing the number of dimensions of an image and thus simplifying the analyses. \n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand and describe how digitized images are represented in a computational environment\n",
    "- Develop an intuition on how images are processed in a number of ways using matrix algebra\n",
    "- Evaluate the role of PCA towards facial recognition with Eigenfaces\n",
    "- Explain how Image compression can be achieved through PCA for performance oriented analyses. "

    "This gives us a starting point for our PCA analysis, as we did with simpler datasets earlier. Here each image becomes an observation, whereas the pixel values represent dimensions of the data (Remember all images have same dimensions). Once we have performed PCA, we have our original data in terms of the eigenvectors we found from the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this useful? \n",
    "\n",
    "For an application like object/facial recognition, we can start with a dataset containing objects/people's faces. Given a new , previously unseen face image, We can identify the object (or whose image is it when it is a face), based on images available in the training dataset. For such an application, we measure the difference between the new image and the original images. This difference is measured on the new axes described by PCA instead of original dataset. Below is a quick example of how this may look in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"eigen.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "## EigenFaces\n",
    "PCA has a very good application which is in the computer vision domain, called __EigenFace__. Eigenface is a name for eigenvectors which are the components of the face itself. It has been used for face recognition where the most variations considered as important. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that these axes works much better for facial recognition, because the PCA analysis gives us the original images in terms of the differences and similarities between it, and the new face i.e. identifying the statistical patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the vectors are $n^2$ dimensional, we can get $n^2$ eigenvectors. In practice, we are able to leave out some of the less significant eigenvectors, and the recognition still performs well with a comparatively low cost.\n",
    "This behavior is shown in the example below.\n",

    "## PCA for image compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction offered by PCA can also be used for image compression. This idea is known as also know as \"Hotelling Transform\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like earlier, if we have 20 images, each with $N^2$ pixels, we can create  $N^2$ vectors, each with 20 dimensions. Each vector consists of all the intensity values from the same pixel from each picture. This is different from the previous example because before we had a vector for image, and each item in that vector was a different pixel, whereas now\n",
    "we have a vector for each pixel, and each item in the vector is from a different image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we perform the PCA on this set of data. We will get 20 eigenvectors because each vector is 20-dimensional. To compress the data, we can then choose to transform the data only using, say 15 of the eigenvectors instead of 20. This gives us a final data set with only 15 dimensions, which will save a lot of storage space. However, when the original data is reproduced, the images have lost some of the information. This compression technique is said to be __lossy__ because the decompressed image is not exactly the same as the original, generally worse. An example of a such a lossy compression is shown below.\n",

    "On the left we see the actual images which are then converted to eigenvectors. On the extreme right we see a reconstructed image, which due to the lossy nature of this approach, takes away some details. All the intermediate images show images created with lesser number of eigenvectors. We can see that with just the right amount of compression, the key features of the faces are preserved. Such techniques could be helpful where performance of a algorithm in terms of speed and agility is desired above all. "
